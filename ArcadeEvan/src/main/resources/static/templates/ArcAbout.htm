                <center><p style="font-size: 22; font-family: Iceland; margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100;">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I (Evan Munro) am the maker of this website. Arcade Evan is the final project that I have made for the full-stack programming course at the Arkansas Coding Academy in the summer of 2020. The idea for this project stemmed from my joy for making the games that you can find on this website and from the interesting programming challenges that I foresaw in creating the arcade interface. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The version of Brick Breaker on this site was made by Cameron Clark, TJ Norris, and myself in our freshman seminar class at the University of Denver. It took the three of us the entire semester to complete it with the guidance of our instructor. After taking this ArCA course I estimate it would take less than a week LOL. Until I got to this class I hadn't touched the game's code since that freshman-year class in 2014. During this course I tinkered with it to improve the dynamics and added a few little features to the original program, and I plan on making new levels after I do some job hunting. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The version of Kings Corner that I have on this site was made entirely by myself during this course. I originally made it as a purely Java application, but then I quickly realized I wouldn't be able to insert it into a website. That led me to redoing the entire game in JavaScript to make the game more accessible and to practice my JavaScript skills. I plan on making a new version of Kings Corner post-job hunt that allows the user to pick the difficulty level of the 'computer' opponent. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I am pleased to offer others the opportunity to play my games, which I hope to make more of, and an interface to compete and communicate with others in a little arcade community. Please contact me via email with any ideas or critiques of this project, or if you want to give me a job ;).<br> Thanks for visiting! </p></center>
